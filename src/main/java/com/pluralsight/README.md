# Challenges

Mandatory pineapple rule: Making sure every pizza always has pineapple and can’t be removed. It took a little thinking to handle this cleanly without breaking the topping system. 

Receipt formatting: Ensuring prices lined up nicely and always showed two decimals while keeping the receipt readable. Formatting CSV output had similar challenges. 

Toppings logic: Adding and removing toppings, handling extras, and calculating their prices based on pizza size required careful loops and condition checks.

User input handling: Making the menus intuitive while handling invalid input gracefully was tricky at first—but it made the program much more user-friendly.


# Cool things
Pineapple is mandatory: It’s a fun, quirky rule that adds personality to the project.

The whole project was pretty cool! :)

# What I learned
How to use inheritance and polymorphism in Java for a real-world scenario.

Managing lists of items (ArrayList) and manipulating them.

Formatting strings and numbers cleanly for user-friendly output.

Structuring a program with menus, loops, and conditional logic to handle multiple layers of user input.

How to think like a small business programmer; handling orders, calculating prices, and producing reports.

# I'd like to thank Kavon for helping me debug, without her, I'd probably still be stuck in an infinite loop anywhere. 
# Thanks to my dog Winter, who bravely sacrificed all her playtime to keep me company while I coded.
# Shoutout to my friends for keeping me somewhat focused when I wanted to take a nap.
# And of course, thanks to my coaches for being here to support.
