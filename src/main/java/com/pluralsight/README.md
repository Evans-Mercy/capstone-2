# Cherry's Pineapple Pizza Shop 

---

Welcome to **Cherry's Pineapple Pizza**, where **pineapple is always included** - because why not?! and every pizza is a little slice of happiness.

This Java program lets you run your own quirky pizza shop from the console.

### Technologies Used

- Java 17
- Collections(ArrayList)
- File I/O (Saving receipts and CSV files)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts

---

## What it does

-  Build a pizza with your choice of **size**, **crust**, and **stuffed crust**.
-  Add extra toppings, but pineapple is **MANDATORY** (you can’t remove it!).
-  Add drinks and Garlic Knots to complete the order.
- Checkout and **generate a receipt** or **save your order to a CSV**.

## How It Works

1. Start the program and choose **New Order** from the home menu.
2. Pick your pizza size, crust, and whether you want it stuffed.
3. Add toppings but remember, PINEAPPLE IS ALWAYS INCLUDED!
4. Add drinks or Garlic Knots if you’re feeling extra hungry.
5. Checkout to see a fancy receipt with all your delicious choices.

## Challenges

Mandatory pineapple rule: Making sure every pizza always has pineapple and can’t be removed. It took a little thinking to handle this cleanly without breaking the topping system. 

Receipt formatting: Ensuring prices lined up nicely and always showed two decimals while keeping the receipt readable. Formatting CSV output had similar challenges. 

Toppings logic: Adding and removing toppings, handling extras, and calculating their prices based on pizza size required careful loops and condition checks.

User input handling: Making the menus intuitive while handling invalid input gracefully was tricky at first, but it made the program much more user-friendly.

## Cool things
Pineapple is mandatory: It’s a fun, quirky rule that adds my personality to the project.

The whole project was pretty cool! :)

## What I learned
How to use inheritance and polymorphism in Java for a real-world scenario.

Managing lists of items (ArrayList) and manipulating them.

Formatting strings and numbers cleanly for user-friendly output.

Structuring a program with menus, loops, and conditional logic to handle multiple layers of user input.

How to think like a small business programmer; handling orders, calculating prices, and printing receipts.
